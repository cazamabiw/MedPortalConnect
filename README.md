4.Waitlist Overview: Users can view their waitlist location, healthcare providers, and check the status, position, and estimated wait time.
5.Add Waitlist Location: Users can add their waitlist location. The system prefers examples in Ottawa and random healthcare providers. When users add a location, it automatically suggests the best top 3 healthcare providers to minimize wait times. However, users can also manage (add and delete) healthcare providers based on their preferences and location.
Note: If users update their location, it will clear and remove their waitlist healthcare providers automatically. The system will then repeat the process of suggesting the best top 3 healthcare providers based on their newly selected location.
